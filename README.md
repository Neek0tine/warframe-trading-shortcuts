# Warframe Trading Hotkey
A small AHK Script I made to automate customer service and fasten trading session by 80%.
- `Alt + 1` : say "Sure thing!"`
- `Alt + 2` : Say "Wait a moment, please!"
- `Alt + 3` : say "Thank you and good luck! :D"
- `Alt + 4` : say "Sorry for the inconvenience :("
- `Alt + 5` : say "Sorry, wrong chat! :P"


# Do whatever you want with it
